		<h2>MirraMirra</h2>
		<div class = "mirraMirrPic"><img id = "mirraMirraPic" src = "mirramirra.jpg"></div>
		<p>MirraMirra is a smart mirror application designed to run in a windows environment 
		programmed using c# with the code available to download from my github. It runs on a 
		display placed behind a two way mirror to present information to a user while theyâ€™re 
		looking in a mirror. It uses a basic gui developed in windows forms and currently presents 
		the time, date, weather, and a random compliment. Creating this program allowed me to learn
		a lot about creating guis for c# and a lot about using and interacting with apis, as I used
		the open weather map api to provide constantly updated weather information. It is still a
		work in development and is constantly being updated by me.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>Sweat Gymnasium Database Management System</h3>
		<div class = "sweatpic"><img id = "sweatpic" src = "sweatlogo.png"></div>
		<p>As part of an A level assignment I created a completely bespoke piece of software to allow a local gym to easily manage a database of all of their clients, as well as workout routines and other important information that used to be stored on paper and through excel spreadsheets. This was programmed using python implementing qt4 libraries for the gui and an sqlite library for the database manipulation and management. This process took a long time spanning the course of several months and taught me not only a lot about programming large pieces of software, working with databases, and programming guis from the ground up, but also a lot about working with clients, making sure their needs are met, and adhering to the software development lifecycle, as well as getting a lot of experience using git. </p>
