		year of computer science at the University of Lincoln. I have a large knowledge of various 
		programming languages including python, Java, the C family as well as front end web design 
		skills. In my spare time I mainly just play video games, take hot bubble baths and make music. 
		If you're interested in contacting me for any of these reason please find my skills, previous projects

		<h2>MirraMirra</h2>
		<div class = "mirraMirrPic"><img id = "mirraMirraPic" src = "mirramirra.jpg"></div>
		<p>MirraMirra is an open source piece of smartmirror software developed in c# originally to be 
		run on a windows tablet attached to the back of a 2 way mirror to create a mirror 
		that could display information such as the time and date, the weather, random compliments
		and more. I created this as a way too learn how to make gui based applications in c#
		and because I had an old tablet with a broken power supply that needed a use.</p>

		<h3>Sweat Gymnasium Database Management System</h3>
		<div class = "sweatpic"><img id = "sweatpic" src = "sweatlogo.png"></div>
		<p>As part of my A level coursework I used python, qt and sql to create a 
		completely bespoke piece of database management software for a local 
		gymnasium. This took several months of constant work and taught me a lot
		about collaborative work and creating projects to the specification of a 
		client. </p>
